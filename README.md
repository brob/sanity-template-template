# Readme describing the full template

This README should talk about what this Starter does. It will be pulled into the page at [sanity.io/create](https://sanity.io/create), but also should mention how to contribute to the Starter, as well as use it.

* `/assets/` is where your preview images will go
* `/data/` is where a Sanity dataset export will go if you want to give default data
* `/template/` is where your site and studio will go
